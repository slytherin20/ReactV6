Error boundaries are only for class components and not functional components
ComponentDidCatch(): when you are expecting errors in your application. Ex: when you know
that a url is gonna return nothing or error as you are not puting any component there.

HOC  = functions that include functionalities to add but does not display them.


Context is like a global value that is available throughtout our application like the dark theme or light theme. 
Context is universally applicable. Eg: What user is logged in. so the user info is accessible throughout the application.

Diff b/w state and Context:
State: disappears when component is derendered.
Context: Stays even if component is derendered because it is decalred in App at global level.

Ref:  container for state that survives past render cycles.

Portals can be used for contextual sidebars, contextual navbars apart from just modals.

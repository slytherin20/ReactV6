Error boundaries are only for class components and not functional components
ComponentDidCatch(): when you are expecting errors in your application. Ex: when you know
that a url is gonna return nothing or error as you are not puting any component there.

HOC  = functions that include functionalities to add but does not display them.


Context is like a global value that is available throughtout our application like the dark theme or light theme.

Diff b/w state and Context:
State: disappears when component is derendered.
Context: Stays even if component is derendered because it is decalred in App at global level.
